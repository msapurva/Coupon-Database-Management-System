# Coupon-Database-Management-System
Designed a database for a prototype coupon and offer management wallet for customers and brands


## Project Summary
The project focuses on designing a database for a prototype coupon and offer management wallet for customers and brands.
Offers and coupons are essential part of marketing. Companies generate multiple marketing offers over emails, mails, SMS and in some cases phone calls, to push sales and attract customers. The uncountable number of brands targeting customers along with sheer number of offers available create a deluge of offers for customers, which are easy to receive but hard to manage and access at the right time and right place. This causes lot of frustration for customers and poor marketing performance for the brand, a lose-lose situation.
The offer management wallet is a system that will allow easy receival, save and retrieval of coupons for customers, empowering them to find and use the right coupon at the right time, just with a click of a button. Further, the offer wallet will act as a one-stop place to find and reach out to prospective customers and evaluate coupon campaign performance. In addition to Business-to-customer interactions, the offer wallet will also allow customer-to-customer interactions allowing customers to share coupons with each other and review products launched by brands.
Successful implementation of offer management wallet will require design and implementation of a comprehensive database that captures and stores data of all aspects of system. For example, data of products, product brands and categories; offers launched by brands for each product; information on coupons saved in a userâ€™s wallets; and offers redeemed by users along with location. Further, it should also store user-to-user interactions and user product reviews.
